# Magnum

Magnum is a Twitch client **alternative**, focusing on watching multiple streams simultaneously.

Unlike other multi-Twitch platforms, Magnum works best when linked to your Twitch account. Namely, by utilizing your account's followed channels to watch additional streams with a click of a button. It also gives the ability to browse categories (games) via the channels sidebar. While logged in, add or remove categories via the settings menu in the top right corner.

More features coming soon (TM).


## Getting Started

1) Open [Magnum](https://magnum-twitch.vercel.app/)
2) Link your Twitch account by clicking the Login button
3) Click on many streams

## Lore

- One stream is not enough
- Two tabs is too many

## Why did you build this in NextJs? X would have been so much better.

You're right.

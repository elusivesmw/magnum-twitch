# Magnum

Magnum is a Twitch client **alternative**, focusing on watching multiple streams simultaneously.

Unlike other multi-Twitch platforms, Magnum works best when linked to your Twitch account. Namely, by utilizing your following list to watch additional streams with a click of a button.

## Getting Started

1) Open [Magnum](https://magnum-twitch.vercel.app/)
2) Link your Twitch account by clicking the Login button
3) Click on many streams

## Lore

- One stream is not enough
- Two tabs is too many
